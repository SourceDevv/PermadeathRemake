# Permadeath Remake

Hey! you might be wondering what is this Minecraft Plugin about.

This is a complete remake of **"Permadeath" SMP**, made by spanish creator **"ElRichMC"**, every difficulty change and custom stuff ported from *1.15.2* to **1.21.10** version.

## Gameplay
This "challenge" is based on 110 days inside a hardcore world but modified. If you die, you get banned from the server (unless a teammate / player revives you). Every 10 days the game gets harder, making the experience a lot more entertaining. For special / custom changes, every 5 days you get one, same as the original SMP.

You can check the Permadeath SMP Wiki to see the difficulty changes. This series ended at day 60, because every survivor died. In this plugin we remastered the experience adding all 110 days, with new (and secret) changes for day 70, 80, etc.
Also, we added a Revive player mechanic, where you can craft a special item and revive your teammate, making it a bit more fair for new players.

## About the plugin
This plugin is my first ever released plugin, and was made for fun, I decided to make it open-source, so anyone can see the source code that makes magic happen! if you find any bug / error, please join my **Discord server: discord.gg/gottacreatediscordserverlol** and report it on "bug-reports" forum.
